This is a comprehensive README template designed specifically for a Financial Machine Learning repository. It balances technical rigor with clear documentation, which is crucial for financial projects where reproducibility and risk assessment are paramount.

FinML: Predictive Modeling for Financial Markets
This repository contains a suite of Machine Learning models designed for financial time-series forecasting, risk assessment, and algorithmic strategy development. Our goal is to bridge the gap between traditional quantitative finance and modern deep learning architectures.

🚀 Key Features
Alpha Generation: Models focusing on predicting price movement and returns.

Backtesting Engine: A robust framework to test strategies against historical data, accounting for slippage and transaction costs.

Feature Engineering: Automated pipelines for technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and sentiment analysis.

Risk Management: Integrated modules for calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall.
